There are many great Habit trackers ; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a habit tracker that'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on only something you really need. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* You shouldn't woory about keeping record of habits.

Of course, no Habit trackers will serve all your needs since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have reviewed to expanding this project.
